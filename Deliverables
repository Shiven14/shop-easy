1. Github Repo Link
https://github.com/Shiven14/shop-easy
2. Git commands I used and why
mkdir shop-easy && cd shop-easy

- made a clean folder for the project.
cat > spec.txt <<'EOF'

EOF

- created the spec.txt file with the required text.
git init
git add spec.txt
git commit -m "Add spec.txt with ShopEasy specifications"

- initialized git, staged the file, and committed it.
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Shiven14/shop-easy.git
git push -u origin main

- set up the remote repo and pushed the main branch.
git checkout -b A
sed -i '' '2s/.*/Cart totals are shown in dollars (rounded)./' spec.txt
git add spec.txt
git commit -m "A: show totals in dollars (rounded)"
git push -u origin A
git checkout main

- made branch A, changed line 2 to the dollars version, committed, pushed, then went back to main.
git checkout -b B
sed -i '' '2s/.*/Cart totals are shown in cents and displayed as $X.XX./' spec.txt
git add spec.txt
git commit -m 'B: cents displayed as $X.XX'
git push -u origin B
git checkout main

- made branch B from main, changed line 2 to the cents/$X.XX version, committed, pushed, then switched back.
git merge A -m "Merge branch A into main"
git push

-merged branch A into main (fast-forward).
git merge B
git status
cat spec.txt

- tried merging B, saw the merge conflict, and opened the file to look at the conflict markers.
cat > spec.txt <<'EOF'

git add spec.txt
git commit -m "Resolve conflict on line 2: combine A and B"
git push

- rewrote the file with a combined version of the line, added it, committed, and pushed the final result.

3. Why there was a merge conflict
Because both branch A and branch B edited the same exact line in spec.txt (line 2). Git couldnâ€™t automatically pick which change to keep, so it marked the conflict in the file for me to fix manually.

4. How I resolved the conflict
I opened the file and saw the conflict markers. Then I deleted the markers and replaced both versions with one combined version: Cart totals are shown in dollars (rounded) and displayed as $X.XX. After that I staged the file with git add, committed with a clear message, and pushed to GitHub.

5. Commit messages I used
Add spec.txt with ShopEasy specifications


A: show totals in dollars (rounded)


B: cents displayed as $X.XX
